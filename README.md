This project is a fork of “https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new” 🚀.
All rules depend on bolt.new, so be sure to check it out.

This project includes the following points
☑Allows you to choose which LLM to use on the screen
☑The original bolt.new command was for linux environments, so I updated it to work on windows.

Usage:
1. run the following command
```ps:
pnpm install
```

2. Create “.env.local” in the project root and add the following definition
```.env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR OPENAI API KEY>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<YOUR ANTHROPIC API KEY>
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

3. When ready, run the following command in a powershell and you are good to go!
```
pnpm run start
```
